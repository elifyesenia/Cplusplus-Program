# Cplusplus-Program
This project is a password management tool written in C++. It aims to securely manage multiple passwords by providing a centralized storage solution. 
The program features a clear command-line interface and utilizes a map data structure to efficiently associate passwords. 
The code is well-structured and easy to understand, demonstrating proficiency in user interface design and data structure usage. 
However, to improve security, error handling, and memory management, implementing encryption techniques, robust error handling mechanisms, 
and dynamic memory allocation would be beneficial. Ensuring program security was a challenge, but research and consultation with relevant documentation 
helped overcome this obstacle. Transferable skills from this project include understanding data structures, user interface design, and error handling. 
The program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability were achieved through meaningful variable names, comments, modular program logic, and 
encapsulation of sensitive data within the PasswordManager class.
